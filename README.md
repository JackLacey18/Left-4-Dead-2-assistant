This will create the console.log file that can be parsed. The log will be located in a path similar to below.
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Left 4 Dead 2\left4dead2\console.log"

Ensure the correct file path of the console.log file is stored in the console_file_path.txt file.

The script is to be run in command line. Navigate to the location you have stored the files and run the script.

The script is fully controllable from the developer console in Left 4 Dead 2. Type 'help' in the developer console to get a full list of functions you can perform with script.
